# Matrix Multiplication Analysis

This project analyzes the performance of matrix multiplication for matrices of sizes 2048x2048 and 8192x8192 using different tile sizes. The goal is to compare execution time and efficiency when varying tile dimensions in matrix multiplication.

## Problem Statement

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in many numerical algorithms. This project focuses on multiplying large matrices (2048x2048 and 8192x8192) while breaking them into smaller tiles to optimize memory usage and processing time. Tiling helps to improve cache utilization, reduce cache misses, and enhance performance.

## Project Overview

- **Matrix Sizes**: 
  - 2048 x 2048
  - 8192 x 8192
- **Tile Sizes**: 
  - Multiple tile sizes will be tested (e.g., 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, etc.)
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Execution time
  - Cache utilization
